## Maze generation

### Iterative implementation
The depth-first search algorithm of maze generation is implemented using backtracking.
Implemented as it can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Iterative_implementation).

## Future

Implement path finding algorithms to find the shortest path in a generated Maze.

Implementation contain:

- [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinding#Dijkstra's_algorithm)
- [A* algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinding#A*_algorithm)
