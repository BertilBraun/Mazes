Repository for playing with mazes in python

## Maze generation

### Iterative implementation
The depth-first search algorithm of maze generation is implemented using backtracking.

Implemented as it can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Iterative_implementation).

## Path Finding

Implemented path finding algorithms to find the shortest path in a generated Maze.

Implementation contain:

- [A* algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinding#A*_algorithm)

![Maze Path](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BertilBraun/Mazes/main/img/MazePath.png)

## Future

- Implement the basic [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinding#Dijkstra's_algorithm)
- Optimize Graph layout by combining straight edges to one
